        H-E-B Project

    <p class="p-block">
During my internship at <a href="https://www.heb.com/">H-E-B</a> this past summer, I had the opportunity to work on a project under the Cart to Home Team at H-E-B Digital. I worked on moving the Time Slot Picker (used in choosing a time slot for curbside/delivery of groceries) from Vue to React. I connected the component to real data through GraphQL queries and mutations that I made. I used Apollo to connect the GraphQL to React. I also updated the UI for the Time Slot Picker to match the newer design that other pages on H-E-B have. Those were all viewed in Storybook. It was difficult to do a remote internship, but I learned a lot in eight short weeks. I enjoyed working on a project that I know will soon be live and in production since the Time Slot Picker is a vital part of H-E-B’s eCommerce, especially since COVID has increased the demand for curbside and delivery services.

I participated in A&M’s hackathon in January 2020. I made a website called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/plane-sleep">Plane Sleep</a>, which provided users with tips on how to relax on a plane or to even sleep on a plane. It was geared for those with the fear of flying and new travelers. It was my first time making a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I used Firebase to host the site. For a 24-hour project, I am proud of the turnout of the design and content, especially since I made it by myself where as other projects were made by teams.

I have been the Historian for the Hindu Students Association at Texas A&M for two years. Last year, I completely updated the design of the <a href="https://hsatamu.wixsite.com/hsatamu">website</a>, and I added a lot more relevant content. I continuously update the site with new content, such as when we are advertising upcoming events.
