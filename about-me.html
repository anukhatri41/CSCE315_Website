                Howdy! My name is Anu Khatri, and I am junior Computer Science major from Plano, TX, and I am the loudest and proudest member of the Fightin’ Aggie Class of 2022! I am also pursuing a minor in Art – New Media because I am more interested in front-end development.
                <br><br>
                The reason I chose to study computer science is that I am very interested in how technology has given industries the capability to make customer experiences better and provide better accessibility. Additionally, I have seen how many companies are being transformed into technology companies where their previous focus is now on the side. For example, H-E-B is becoming a technology company that just happens to sell groceries. These shifts have shown me there is so much room for growth and that I will constantly be learning during my career.
                <br><br>
                Outside of school, I am quite involved on campus. I have been a counselor for Fish Camp the past two years. Fish Camp is an extended orientation that freshmen have the opportunity to attend before they start college to help their transition. I worked with 25 other upperclassmen to create and co-facilitate activities and bonding experiences to foster a sense of community and provide a support system during all of college.
                I am also involved in the Hindu Students Association, where I have been the Historian for two years. Last year, I completely redesigned the website and social media, and we have been able to greatly increase our online engagement, which has translated to growing our membership. 
                The Hullabaloo Band is another organization that I am in. We play at volleyball and basketball games. It has allowed me to continue playing music in college, something which is very important to me because music has played a huge part in my life. 
                In my free time, I like to embroider, hang out with my friends, listen to music, and travel. I really enjoy concerts, so one of the first things I will do when it is safe again is try to attend a concert! The last one I went to, I saw Colony House, and it was a really cool experience.
